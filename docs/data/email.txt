As discussed, attached are some example matrices and vectors that our model
would output:

  1.  ProlifPop.txt proliferative cell population (counts matrix)
  2.  NecroPop.txt necrotic cell population (counts matrix)
  3.  MarkerMass_E_T.txt extracellular marker mass in tumor compartments
  (concentration matrix; ng/mL)
  4.  MarkerMass_E_P.txt extracellular marker mass in plasma (concentration
  vector; ng/mL)
  5.  MarkerMass_NE_T.txt non-extracellular marker mass in tumor compartments
  (concentration matrix; ng/mL)
  6.  MarkerMass_NE_P.txt non-extracellular marker mass in plasma
  (concentration vector; ng/mL)

Other clarifications:

  *   In the matrices, each column is a compartment, or cylindrical region in
      space dependent on radial distance to vasculature.
  *   In the vectors, the column represents the plasma/vasculature "compartment".
  *   Each row is a time point with unit of days elapsed since tumorigenesis.
  *   We associate extracellular shedding with the proliferative population and
      non-extracellular shedding with the necrotic population
  *   for the discussed "tube"/zoomed in density cloud visualization: {1,3,4}
      for extracellular markers or {2,5,6} for non-extracellular

1) In the matrix files, what is the first column?  You mentioned time measured
in days elapsed since tumorigenesis, but then why are the first columns
different in different files (and why does ProlifPop start at 1)?

2) Do you have a list of radial distances for the compartment boundaries?


1. The first column is the first compartment. Time is not a column on that
matrix because each row is a day. For a matrix M, entry M(1,5) is the 1st day
5th compartment. M(1,1) = 1 for ProlifPop since it starts with one seeding
tumor cell. TL;DR: the row index is the timestamp.


2. The thickness of a compartment is 0.01 mm (10 Âµm). The distances to
vasculature (in mm) for compartment i=1...n=10 are: 

 0.0050    0.0150    0.0250    0.0350    0.0450    0.0550    0.0650    0.0750    0.0850    0.0950


Are you interpreting fractional cell counts as cell density then?  Do you have
a distance/scale in the non-radial dimension (along the vasculature)?

* Yes, fractional cell count is a sort of density measure

* The distance/scale along the vasculature grows with the tumor (allocating more
carrying capacity) via a vascularization function
    - As of now, this function is linear with time (some small mm/day increase) 
    - We hope to make this cell density-dependent in the future to mimic
      angiogenic factors and vessel recruitment from growing tumors
